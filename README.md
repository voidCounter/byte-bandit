## Architecture

Oakcan follows a microservices architecture pattern designed for scalability, maintainability, and learning modern distributed systems concepts. The architecture is built around the principle of service independence while maintaining coordinated communication through well-defined interfaces.

### Core Components

- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing, authentication, and request handling. Acts as the single entry point for all client requests, implementing security filters, CORS policies, and request routing to appropriate microservices.

- **User Service**: Handles user lifecycle management including registration, authentication, email verification, and profile management. Manages JWT token generation and validation, and publishes user events to Kafka for other services to consume.

- **File Service**: Manages the complete file system operations including file/folder CRUD operations, permissions, sharing mechanisms, and integration with AWS S3 for file storage. Maintains its own database with user snapshots received via Kafka events.

- **Discovery Server**: Eureka-based service discovery that enables dynamic service registration and discovery. Provides a dashboard for monitoring service health and availability across the microservices ecosystem.

- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config. Stores configuration files for all services, enabling environment-specific configurations and dynamic updates without service restarts.

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbaa0278-5832-4d5f-972a-fcff0713a5ac)


### Architecture Patterns & Communication

**Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate asynchronously through Apache Kafka, particularly for user lifecycle events. When a user verifies their email, the User Service publishes a `USER_VERIFIED` event that the File Service consumes to create user snapshots and home directories.

**Database Per Service**: Each service maintains its own database schema, ensuring data isolation and service independence. The User Service database handles authentication and user management, while the File Service database manages file system operations and permissions.

**API-First Design**: All services expose RESTful APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, enabling easy integration and testing. The API Gateway provides unified access to these services with consistent authentication and authorization.

**Containerized Deployment**: All services are containerized using Docker, with orchestration handled by Docker Compose for local development and testing environments.

## Data Model

### User Service Database
![User Service Database Schema](public/images/user_db_er.png)

The User Service maintains its own database for user management, authentication, and email verification. It handles user registration, login, and sends events to other services via Kafka when user state changes.

### File Service Database  
![File Service Database Schema](public/images/file_db_er_diagram.png)

The File Service operates on a separate database optimized for file system operations. It maintains user snapshots (received via Kafka events) and manages the hierarchical file structure with permissions and sharing capabilities.

## API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available online with interactive Swagger UI at [https://oakcan-docs.pages.dev/api/reference/gateway/](https://oakcan-docs.pages.dev/api/reference/gateway/). The API follows RESTful principles and includes:

- Authentication endpoints
- File management operations
- User management
- Sharing and permissions

You can explore and test the APIs directly from the documentation without needing to run the services locally.
